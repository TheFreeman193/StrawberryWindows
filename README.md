# üçì Windows Builds for Strawberry Music Player

Strawberry is a music player and a music collection organizer. It is a fork of Clementine originally released in 2018 and aimed at music collectors and audiophiles. It's written in C++ using the Qt toolkit.

Currently, only Linux binaries are available for free and macOS and Windows users must either subscribe on Patreon or build it from source.
I am therefore building my own release binaries of Strawberry on Windows using Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) and making my build configuration and artifacts available here.

I make no guarantees about the functionality of these builds, although I test them on 64-bit Windows 10 & Windows 11 systems before uploading to GitHub to ensure Strawberry starts and can play audio. I am not currently building for x86 or ARM64 as none of my systems run these architectures.

These builds rely on the Microsoft Visual C++ redistributable to run. This should install automatically when using the NSIS installer. If it doesn't, or you are extracting from the archive, you can get the latest redistributable from the [Microsoft website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist#latest-microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-version).
